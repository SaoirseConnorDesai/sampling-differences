This repository contains material associated with:

- Wen, Y. P., Desai, S. C., Navarro, D. J., & Hayes, B. K. (in preparation).
  *Who is sensitive to selection biases in inductive reasoning?*

The structure of this repository is based on Danielle Navarro's 
[cogsci-template](https://github.com/djnavarro/cogsci-template) and roughly 
mirrors the conventions documented there. It contains the following folders, 
each with their own README.md file:

- [inputs](./inputs) contains the files I was provided with, unedited
- [preprocessing](./preprocessing) contains an R script that reads input files,
  tidies and cleans the data, and exports the organised version of the files to
  the data folder
- [data](./data) contains the cleaned data files as .csv files
- [models](./models) contains an R script implementing the theoretical model
- [analysis](./analysis) contains an R markdown document that analyses the data
  (from the data folder) with the assistance of the model (models folder) 
- [writeup](./writeup) does not contain the complete manuscript, only the 
  technical appendix that describes the formal specification of the model

The repository is not complete. Some things on the to-do list:
  
- other resources (e.g., OSF folders, Overleaf documents, Google docs)
that are linked to the project, should be linked from this readme
- data files do not have a proper data dictionary yet
- writeup files and the html output from the analysis folder should probably
  be made easily accessible via GH Pages
